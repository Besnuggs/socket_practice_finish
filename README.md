# socket_practice_finish
Finished product of a training exercise I put together to demonstrate socket.io as a basic chat application for my co-workers.
It was part of a thirty minute slide presentation I put together to demonstrate how to setup a node server leveraging express to serve
static files, and socket.io for real-time connection among multiple clients.
